<p>Star Odyssey: Version O</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Resources:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Briterium: Mainly used for defense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ridon: Mainly used for science.</p>
<p>Kriden: Mainly used for offense.</p>
<p>Money: Gained via taxes. Used for everything. Only non-military civilians pay taxes.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The draft:</p>
<p>You can draft your civilians into one of three roles in the military. These roles are perm.</p>
<p>Research: Scientists, the more that work on a project, the faster it gets done.</p>
<p>Military: These are the guys that go into ships that you send off to blow shit up.</p>
<p>Miners: Sucks for these guys. Mine the planet for Briterium / Ridon / Kriden.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Note: Military personnel are too busy to fuck. Only civilians make more civilians at a decent rate.</p>
<p>Civilians also keep the money coming in. Try to balance this.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Attack Ships:</p>
<p>&nbsp;These take money and Kriden to build. Get Kriden by mining it. Anything &apos;advanced&apos; has to be researched.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Research advantage is slightly more power, and less resources / cash / crew needed to man them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;These are meant for offense. They&apos;re powerful but have low defense, so they&apos;re best used for attacking.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Defense Ships:</p>
<p>&nbsp;These take money and Britierum to build. Get Briterium by mining it. Anything &apos;advanced&apos; has to be researched&apos;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Research advantage is slightly more power, and less resources / cash / crew needed to man them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Defensive ships can take more hits than give them, perfect against your enemies attack ships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Best to leave these guys at home, unless you want to be defenseless.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Special Ships:</p>

<p>They&apos;re fitted with telescopes and stealth tech, not weapons. Cannot attack. Low defense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lower # of (any) at-home ship, the less chance of getting caught sending one of these out.</p>
<p>If one is caught, then 1 of 3 things happen:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- The ship is destroyed, and the user is notified that someone was spying on them. (common)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- The ship is captured, and the user is notified WHO was spying on them, and keeps their ship. (uncommon)</p>
